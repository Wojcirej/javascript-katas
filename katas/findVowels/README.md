# Find vowels

### Description
Create a function, which finds all vowels in the passed string. Vowels should be returned as a string, and they should be capitalized as well.

This exercise also served me as practice of `pipe` implementation - popular concept in functional programming.

### Examples
```javascript
findVowels('mama'); // 'AA'
findVowels('lol'); // 'O'
```
